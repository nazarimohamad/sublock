            Collaborative development of Hyperledger is a time-stamped series of
            immutable records of data that is managed by a cluster of computers
            joining into that blockchain. It enhances transparency as all the
            information stored cannot be altered. It reduces frauds as the
            nature of its immutability increases confidence in data integrity.
            It eliminates the need for a third party thus reducing overhead
            costs. So, hyperledger technology can track the productâ€™s journey
            from supply chain to retailers.
